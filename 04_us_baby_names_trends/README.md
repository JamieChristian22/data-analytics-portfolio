# U.S. Baby Names (1910–2012) — Popularity Trends

## Business Problem
Analyze long-term naming trends by gender to identify the most popular names and how popularity changes over time.

## Dataset
- **Raw**: name/year/gender dataset with mixed gender labels, name casing issues, missing occurrences, and duplicates.
- **Clean**: standardized gender, title-cased names, imputed occurrences, unique keys.

## Workflow
1. Clean and standardize fields
2. Rank top names by total occurrences (per gender)
3. Build trend analysis for selected names
4. Package SQL queries and Excel dashboard

## Deliverables
- Raw + cleaned CSVs
- Python cleaning + analysis scripts
- SQL schema + analysis queries
- Excel dashboard workbook
- Screenshot reference

## Key Insights (example outputs)
- Classic names dominate across the full century.
- Different names peak in distinct eras (e.g., 1920s vs 1970s vs 2000s).
- Female naming changes tend to be faster than male naming changes.

## Tech Stack
Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI-ready CSV
