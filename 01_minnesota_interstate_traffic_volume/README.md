# Minnesota Interstate Traffic Volume (2018)

## Business Problem
Analyze hourly interstate traffic patterns and quantify how weather and U.S. holidays affect traffic volume. Produce month-level trend, weather breakdown, and hour-of-day patterns for operations planning.

## Dataset
- **Raw**: Hourly observations for 2018 with missing values + duplicates (for cleaning practice)
- **Clean**: De-duplicated and typed dataset with derived fields (month/hour/weekend).

## Workflow
1. Profile raw data (missing values, duplicates, type issues)
2. Clean + standardize
3. Build month trend + weather impact + hour-of-day analysis
4. Package outputs for Excel / SQL / Python

## Deliverables
- Raw + cleaned CSVs
- Python cleaning + analysis scripts
- SQL schema + analysis queries
- Excel dashboard workbook
- Screenshot of your Power BI visual for reference

## Key Insights (example outputs)
- Summer months show higher traffic than winter.
- Snow/Rain reduces hourly traffic.
- Commute peaks around morning and late afternoon.

## Tech Stack
Python (pandas), SQL, Excel, Power BI-ready CSV
